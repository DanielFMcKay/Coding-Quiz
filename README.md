# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

#Note: although it has now reached some functionality, this is currently incomplete and a work in progress

It does function as a quiz, removing and revealing elements of the page as necessary and the styling elements are also basically done. It will store initials and score to Local Storage but only once at the moment. Will work on it later.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```
